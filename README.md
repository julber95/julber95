### 📌 Featured Projects

Here are some of my most accomplished projects:

🔹 **[Enhancing GANs with Discriminator Rejection Sampling](https://github.com/julber95/gan-drs-enhancement-DL)**  
Worked on **improving GANs** by implementing **Discriminator Rejection Sampling (DRS)** and **adaptive  truncation**. This technique enhanced sample quality and diversity in generated images.

🔹 **[Fraud Detection using Machine Learning](https://github.com/julber95/fraud-detection-ML)**  
Developed a **fraud detection model** using **Gradient Boosting** and **Random Forest** to analyze transaction data. Achieved **1st place** in the **ENS Challenge Data competition** with an optimized **Precision-Recall AUC score**.

🔹 **[Real Estate Price Prediction](https://github.com/julber95/house-price-prediction-ML)**  
Built a predictive model for estimating real estate prices based on structured data. Implemented advanced **feature engineering** and **XGBoost optimization**.
